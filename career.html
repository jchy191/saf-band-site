                                    <h6>Concert Master / Woodwind Group Leader</h6>
                                    <h6>ME2 Ang Yi Xiang</h6>
                                    <p>ME2 Yi Xiang is the Woodwind Group Leader of the Singapore Armed Forces Band. He also actively leads a team to choreograph military display performances during overseas military tattoo as well as for the National Day Parade.</p>
                                    <h6>Q: What made you choose a career with the SAF? What is your story?</h6>
                                    <p>A: The main reason I signed on was simply to continue pursuing music. SAF Band is one of the few good choices to do it professionally in Singapore. I took my LTCL (a penultimate-level Licentiate diploma awarded by Trinity College London) about a year into my service and I did pretty well. I was fully reimbursed for it by the unit. It is nice to have an environment where you can improve on your skills as a career requirement.</p>
                                    <h6>Q: You mentioned the importance of tutorship in the development of your musicianship. The organisation provides tuition for its musicians. Would you say this is one of the perks of why you wanted to sign on?</h6>
                                    <p>A: Definitely. Other than having tuition, we also get to utilize the tuition fund to attend master classes by visiting professors and clinicians. This is very helpful as it may be quite costly. In the band, it’s a generous part of your career progression and training as a military musician.</p>
                                    <p>Apart from that, the saxophone section here is very diverse – we all come from different genres of music from pop, to classical, to big band, you name it. The interaction with my colleagues expanded my ability to play different styles, building my versatility as a musician.</p>
                                    <h6>Q: The SAF Band is gradually getting popular in the overseas military tattoo community. What are your thoughts about being the leading choreographer for the tattoo?</h6>
                                    <p>A: Music is internationally recognized. The magic happens when the band is able to bridge language barriers and communicate music through our military display performances. The execution of the marching drills incorporates diversity, adding a layer of depth to further captivate the audience.</p>
                                    <p>Through all these events and performances overseas, I feel that we’ve made a distinct position for the SAF and Singapore on the world map. This gives new meaning to my career and is only possible in a military context; working in any non-military organisation simply does not offer such experience.</p>

                                	<h6>ME2 Ronnie Quek</h6>
                                    <p>ME2 Ronnie is the Brass Group Leader of the Singapore Armed Forces Band. He served as a Drum Major with the Ceremonial Band for about 5 years. During which, he attained his FTCL (the highest level diploma that the Trinity College of London awards) and was the first Military Musician in the unit to do so.</p>
                                    <h6>Q: What do you like about your job; why did you decide to sign on?</h6>
                                    <p>A: Well, I wanted to pursue my dreams of becoming a performer. Being here meant that I can have a conducive environment to practice every day. The rehearsals and performances with the band offer plenty of chances for me to perform. It also helps tremendously that the organization provides tuition with professional musicians, providing constant self-upgrading opportunities.</p>
                                    <h6>Q: What was it like juggling between being a Drum Major and a Musician?</h6>
                                    <p>A: I don’t think it affected my playing. In fact, I got my FTCL while I was a drum major. I feel that as long as we remain focused and committed, nothing will affect our standard of playing. Juggling between both sure wasn’t an easy feat and this is an achievement that I am proud of. The certificate definitely gave me more confidence. The improvements I have made leading up to the exam also opened doors for me to perform with ensembles such as Windstars Ensemble, Singapore Lyric Opera, and Singapore Trombone Society.</p>
                                    <h6>Q: Coming so far, it seems that you have done it all. We also understand that you are the videographer for the unit. How did you get into videography?</h6>
                                    <p>A: It started off as a personal interest – I did not know anything at all. After speaking to my superior, I was sent for a videography course where I learnt some useful skills. Putting these skills to good practice as a videographer for the unit, I would say I’ve came a long way from where I’ve started. I currently film and edit all the videos for the unit.</p>

                                    <h6>Q. Describe the journey to becoming the Chief Drum Major.</h6>
                                    <p>A: I was not a Drum Major in secondary school, but I always had an interest to learn. I spoke to my superiors and they allowed me to train for the role. I was subsequently selected to attend the Drum Major Course with the Defence Force School of Music, Melbourne, Australia.</p>
                                    <p>The course taught me valuable skills and opened my eyes to the endless possibilities that a Drum Major could be. Since then, I felt that our drum majors could be doing so much more. Being Chief Drum Major, I am in an influential position where I can help nurture the newer drum majors in the unit, working hand-in-hand to break the boundaries of what a drum major can do.</p>
                                    <h6>Q: Being on the international stage where you perform in front of thousands, is there any stress, especially with your complex mace work and techniques?</h6>
                                    <p>A: Of course, there is always stress. Every day that I perform is a day in which I feel butterflies in my stomach. The exhilaration of performing as a Drum Major isn’t something easy to come by, and I appreciate and shoulder this role with pride. I get an adrenaline rush from this – especially when I’m doing high mace throws and the crowd goes wild. There are no words to describe this; the validation makes all the blood, sweat and tears worth it.</p>
                                    <h6>Q: What do you think is the future of Drum Majors in Singapore?</h6>
                                    <p>A: I see a lot of potential. The Singapore Armed Forces Band works closely with the Ministry of Education for the yearly Drum Major Non-Commissioned Officer Camp. My team of drum majors and I work tirelessly to structure a comprehensive syllabus for the students during the camp. It is great to be able to educate them about military traditions and the roles of the drum major at such a young age.</p>
                                    <p>The future holds many possibilities for us, the courses for Drum Majors both internally in the SAF and externally for schools are still new. People are still just finding out about Drum Majors and its rich traditions. I want the future of our Drum Majors to be one that is vibrant, alive, and skilled. Slowly but surely, we will get there someday.
